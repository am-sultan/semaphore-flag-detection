# semaphore-flag-detection
This Android application is designed to detect and interpret semaphore flag signals in real-time, making it a valuable tool for those interested in learning or decoding semaphore communication. The app uses machine learning to recognize different semaphore positions captured through the device's camera, offering an interactive and educational experience. Users can view decoded messages instantly, and the app includes a reference section on semaphore signaling for quick learning.

Features:

Real-time semaphore flag detection,
Immediate message decoding based on recognized semaphore signals,
Easy-to-use interface with reference materials on semaphore positions and meanings,
Supports offline use after initial setup,

This project combines Android development with machine learning, utilizing TensorFlow Lite to handle on-device model inference for efficient and fast performance.
